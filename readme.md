## Description üìù

This project is the homepage for "Food's World", a food order management platform. It provides a welcoming first impression to visitors with a modern design based on neumorphism and the ability to switch between a light and dark mode for optimal visual comfort. The goal is to create a simple yet aesthetic entry page for the business.

## Key Features ‚úÖ

* Unique homepage for the "Food's World" business.
* Central display of a welcome message "Bienvenue √† Food's World".
* The message is contained within a frame with rounded corners.
* Page and frame backgrounds use "glowing colors" gradients.
* A button located in the top right allows easy switching between light and dark modes.
* Application of a Neumorphism style to the interface elements (frame, button).
* Uses specific and distinct color palettes for light and dark modes.
* The mode preference (light/dark) is saved in the user's browser (via `localStorage`).

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

* HTML5: For the page structure.
* CSS3: For styling, colors, gradients, neumorphism, and handling light/dark modes.
* JavaScript: To manage the mode toggle button interaction.

## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites üìã

You just need a modern web browser to view this page.

### Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/JohnMoriarty009/foods_selling_website](https://github.com/JohnMoriarty009/foods_selling_website)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd foods_selling_world-homepage
    ```

### Running the Project üö¶

This project is a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which means you can run it directly from your file system without needing a web server.

1.  **Locate the `index.html` file:** Navigate to the root directory of the project where you cloned the repository.
2.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:** Double-click the `index.html` file, or drag and drop it into an open window of your preferred web browser (like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or Apple Safari).
3.  The Food's World homepage should load, displaying the welcome message and the theme toggle button.

*(Note: For more complex web projects involving backend logic or APIs, a local web server would typically be required. However, for this static page, opening the HTML file directly is sufficient.)*
